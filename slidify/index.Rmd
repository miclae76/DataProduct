## Description

The Shiny App I wrote allows you to compare stocks performance. I've limited the
stock list to companies with Capitalisation > 10 Billions USD.

Figures are for the years 2012 to 2014.

---
## Details

Based on real stock price history (Adj Close) renormalized on a 100 basis to allow compariso in return.

---
## Example

Below a sample of the first 5 lines of the CSV file.

```{r head-10-lines, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("D:/Coursera/Repository/DataProduct/perf_history.csv", sep=",", header=T)
head(data, 5)
```

## Lessons learned

- Necessary to use reactive function when multiple inputs

- In the renderPlot function, the name of the dataframe must be followed by parentheses.
